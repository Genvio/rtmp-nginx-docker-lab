# **RTMP NGINX docker lab**

### **Background**
I was looking for some application to demonstrate the container concept. Most of the things on the web involve either simple applications or things that requires some application development concept. As I am an infrastructure guy, I am looking for a no code application that is also substantial in terms of application configuration (not coding).

I chance upon RTMP and NGINX and these will be the focus for this lab.

The initial focus for the lab will be to explore containers on Windows servers but can be expanded to other platform, such as Linux.

# Lab architecture
The lab will demonstrate how to stream video content to NGINX via RTMP. The live stream is then viewed via HLS from the NGINX.

See the diagram below for the various components
